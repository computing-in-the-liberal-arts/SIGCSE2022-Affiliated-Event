## Session Details

### Curricular Innovations panel

Panelists and topics will be posted following acceptance notifications.

### Curricular Innovations breakout sessions

Breakout sessions will begin by being organized around the topics presented by the panelists. However, discussions in each session will provide opportunities for discussion and ideation of ongoing or potential innovations at the participants' institutions.

### Selection of Unconference sessions

A list of proposed unconference sessions is available on the [Resulting Materials page](materials.md); additions to this list will be accepted up until the time of the event and participants will be reminded of the link to this information prior to the lunch break. Upon return from lunch, attendees interact with session organizers and indicate interest in various sessions and a set will be chosen to proceed for the remainder of the afternoon.

### Unconference sessions

Selected sessions will gather and session leaders will follow their provided plan for the allotted time.
An announcement will be made encouraging groups to take a break at the midpoint of the session, but individual sessions will have flexibility to divide up this time in the manner that best suits their topic and intended collaboration.

### Business meeting

The SIGCSE Committee on Computing Education in Liberal Arts College will hold a business meeting open to any attendees who wish to participate. Topics will include planning for the April 1st hybrid CCSC-NE session, identifying new priorities for the Liberal Arts Computing community, and collecting feedback and ideas for future activities. The Committee is always looking for members interested in leading events and welcomes attendees who want to find ways to get more involved.
