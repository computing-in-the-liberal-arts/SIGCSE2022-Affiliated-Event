# ACM/IEEE CS202X Model Curriculum

Contributed by Amanda Holland-Minkley, Washington & Jefferson College
Additional contributors (if any): Jim Teresco, Siena College

## Brief summary of topic

An ACM/IEEE Curriculum Task Force has been formed and begun work on reviewing the current model curriculum, CS2013, and identifying revisions for a new model curriculum to come out in the next couple of years. For structural and philosophical reasons, liberal arts computer science programs often have a different relationship with the ACM/IEEE model curriculum than other types of institutions, with significant variation in how closely schools attempt to follow it or how useful they find it in guiding local curriculum decisions.

## Description of session structure

In this session, we will discuss what elements of the current model curriculum is working well or not for liberal arts computing educators. We will discuss what goals we might have for a revised model curriculum. And we will discuss strategies for advocating for liberal arts perspectives on computing education within the review and revision process.

## Ideal Audience for Session

Any faculty member interested in curriculum issues or the ACM/IEEE curriculum revision are welcome. The session may be of particular interest to those who have been involved in program and curriculum design at their institutions or made use of the ACM/IEEE model curriculum in the past.

## Intended Outcomes or Products

The SIGCSE Charge for the Committee on Computing Education in the Liberal Arts is, firstmost, to provide a voice for the liberal arts computing community in larger discussions of computing education. This session will provide the committee leadership with feedback from members of the community and recommended next steps for gathering broader input and effective methods for advocating for the community.
