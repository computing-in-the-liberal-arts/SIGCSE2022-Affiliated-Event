# Teaching Ethics, Law, and Society in the Digital Age

Contributed by Andrea Tartaro, Furman University

## Brief summary of topic

Full courses, as well as course modules, on ethics and societal impacts of technology are critical to the training of the next generation of technology professionals. Liberal Arts colleges provide a perfect context for such courses, but instructors may be encountering new teaching modalities and classroom dynamics when offering these courses. This session would bring together new and experienced instructors of the ethics, law, and societal impacts of technology.

## Ideal Audience for Session
Faculty who have experience teaching these topics in computing courses or developing courses focused entirely on these themes. Faculty who are interested in developing similar courses in the future.

## Intended Outcomes or Products
Syllabus materials such as readings and assignments, plus best practice guidance for class activities and leading discussion on these topics. Selecting a digital platform for sharing materials (or joining an existing one).
