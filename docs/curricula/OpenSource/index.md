## Description of Curricular Innovation

At Dickinson we have integrated Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and more specifically FOSS with humanitarian goals (HFOSS) into our curriculum. From a practical perspective, FOSS participation provides students with many opportunities for both technical and soft skill development. The openness of the project artifacts (code, documentation, discussions, history) provide rich real-world examples for students to learn from and work with.  Engaging with the open communities surrounding FOSS projects helps students to develop their softer communication and collaboration skills. As open source skills and experience are in high demand, FOSS experience gives our students a unique advantage in their internship and job searches.

Including an emphasis on humanitarian FOSS has provided us a way to gain those very pragmatic advantages, while simultaneously making more explicit the connections between computing and civic minded liberal arts ideals. Many of the communities and challenges that give rise to HFOSS projects connect to broader issues including access, social justice, equity and sustainability that our students are increasingly studying in their non-computing courses.  Thus, HFOSS opens unique opportunities for students to recognize and create meaningful bidirectional connections between their computer science studies and the full breadth of the liberal arts curriculum.  Engaging with HFOSS projects and communities exposes students to idea that computing can be employed to directly effect social change, complementing their already keen awareness of its value to business, technical and personal gain. This elevation of the social value of computing opens a new avenue of appeal, helping students see how learning computing can empower them to impact communities and causes that are important to them, and potentially drawing an additional audience of students to the discipline. Overall, HFOSS has helped us to both offer additional value to our students and to connect more authentically with Dickinson's core institutional mission of providing "a useful education for the common good."

FOSS and HFOSS have been integrated across our computer science curriculum. Students are first exposed to FOSS concepts and examples of HFOSS across two or three sessions early in our introductory course.  This course is a fairly traditional first course using Python and is largely taken by students looking to satisfy the laboratory science graduation requirement.  Thus, introducing HFOSS and computing for social value here reaches our broadest possible audience.  At the intermediate level we have a sequence of two 1/2 courses that build student’s technical skills and familiarize students with FOSS communities and practices through engaging in an HFOSS project. The HFOSS project that we use at this level is FarmData2, which we have created and manage as an authentic open source project in collaboration with the College’s organic farm.  Because we manage this project, we are able to shape the timelines, architecture and technology stack to meet our students where they are (often having had only one prior CS course) while also facilitating our pedagogical objectives (e.g. learning web development, practicing open source workflows, civic/community engagement, preparation for the capstone). Students complete our major with a year-long two-course senior capstone sequence.  In this capstone, students research FOSS and HFOSS projects/communities that are of interest to them. We then form teams around common areas of interest. The teams collaboratively choose projects and engages with their communities “in the wild” using a structured sequence of activities that guide them to increasingly deeper engagement.

We have collected pre/post course survey data at both the intermediate and capstone levels and we have analyzed the types of projects selected (FOSS or HFOSS) by students in the capstone.  Major takeaways from these analyses suggest that (1) students gain an appreciation of the use of computing to contribute to the greater good, (2) students become more likely to contribute to FOSS or HFOSS projects in the future and (3) that the social value of HFOSS projects appeals to students from groups that are underrepresented in our major and in computing more broadly.

## Challenges/Limitations

- Finding space in an already small curriculum for a focus on HFOSS can be difficult.  
  - In order to add the two intermediate level 1/2 courses we removed Programming Language Structures as a required course (it can still be taken as an elective). Because now not all students will take that course, we moved topics that we viewed as essential to other courses (e.g. Some functional programming concepts were moved into our data structures and algorithms courses).
  - Alternatively, courses on web or mobile development or software engineering may provide opportunities to engage students with HFOSS projects, while still achieving many or all of their current learning objectives.
- Engaging students in open source can be challenging for faculty and students.
  - Students often face resource and system administration challenges in getting FOSS projects configured and running.  Students benefit significantly from having had prior exposure to the command line interface and basic system administration skills. Ideally this occurs in a required course to minimize implicit assumptions about abilities.
  - Finding projects of interest that match student's time constraints and technical abilities (e.g. programming language, tooling, scale, etc) can be difficult.  Running or joining an Educational HFOSS project (e.g. FarmData2) can help mitigate this challenge.
  - The learning curve for faculty without open source experience can be steep. Even for faculty with open source experience, it is impossible to be an expert on every project that students choose to engage with. Learning to take on a _coach-like_ role (e.g. suggesting what to try) as opposed to being the content expert (being able to do it on the spot) is an, sometimes uncomfortable, adjustment.
