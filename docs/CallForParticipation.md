# Innovations and Opportunities in Liberal Arts Computing Education

This is a [SIGCSE 2022](https://sigcse2022.sigcse.org) affiliated event organized by members of the [SIGCSE Committee on Computing Education in Liberal Arts Colleges](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/computing-in-the-liberal-arts/).

This event builds on directions and priorities identified at our prior SIGCSE events:
- [SIGCSE 2021 Pre-Symposium event](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/SIGCSE2021-PreSymposium-Event/)
- [SIGCSE 2020 Pre-Symposium event](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/SIGCSE2020-PreSymposium-Event/)

The program committee invites submissions for the following sessions:
* __Curricular Innovations:__ A panel discussion and breakout sessions around curricular innovations that support uniquely liberal arts approaches to computing.
* __Unconfrence:__ An unconference session focused on topics broadly connected to computing in a liberal arts context.

All submissions will be lightly screened by the program committee for suitability. All suitable submissions will be made available to the community through this site and all authors of accepted submissions will receive an invitation to participate in the event.

We also welcome those that would like to attend and participate in this event, but do not have a submission for one of the above sessions.  If you are interested in attending and participating without making a submission please e-mail Grant Braught (<braught@dickinson.edu>) or Amanda Holland-Minkley (<ahollandminkley@washjeff.edu>) to express your interest.

We anticipate being able to invite everyone who expresses interest. However, in the unlikely event that our venue cannot accommodate everyone, attendees will be selected giving first priority to those submitting to one of the sessions and then by reviewing attendance applications to achieve representation from a broad range of institutions. All interested faculty and students are welcome.

All attendees, whether making a submission or not, must also be registered for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. Apart from the required SIGCSE TS registration there will be no additional cost to participants for this event.
