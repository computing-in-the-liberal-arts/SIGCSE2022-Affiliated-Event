# Innovations and Opportunities
# in Liberal Arts Computing Education

A [SIGCSE 2022](https://sigcse2022.sigcse.org) affiliated event organized by members of the [SIGCSE Committee on Computing Education in Liberal Arts Colleges](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/computing-in-the-liberal-arts/).

This event builds on directions and priorities identified at our prior SIGCSE events:
- [SIGCSE 2021 Pre-Symposium event](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/SIGCSE2021-PreSymposium-Event/)
- [SIGCSE 2020 Pre-Symposium event](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/SIGCSE2020-PreSymposium-Event/)

This Pre-Symposium event will promote connection and collaboration within the liberal arts computing community. This full day event will be split into two sessions. The first session will focus on innovations in computing education in the liberal arts and may include courses, curricula, co-curricular programs or other elements that reflect a specifically liberal arts perspective. Selected submissions will be presented and discussed at the event and also be added to the Committee’s growing repository of materials. The second session will be held in an “unconference” format, with proposals accepted for working group topics from the community as a whole. Possible topics include but are not limited to course design and assessment for CS+X courses, strategies for recruiting faculty to teach at liberal arts colleges, and course-specific topics such as implementing specifications grading or implementing inclusive teaching practices. Throughout the event, sessions will give participants an opportunity to learn about work already taking place within the liberal arts computing community as well as to engage in Q&A and breakout discussions. All interested faculty and students are welcome.
